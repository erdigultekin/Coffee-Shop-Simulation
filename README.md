Coffee shop simulation is a computer program which consists of a server and a client written in Java programming language. The program is an educational simulation software to introduce the basics of price- quality models in industrial engineering and designed for in-class usage. The simulation lets the instructor define the different price and quality models for simulated customers to demonstrate the effect of different models in business to his/her students. It also aims to demonstrate the dynamics of inventory management, product pricing and competition among the businesses. Coffee shop simulation has two graphical user interfaces. The first interface is used on the server and it assists the instructor for initializing models and keeping track of competition during the execution of models in the simulation. The second interface is provided for the client and it serves to the students who compete with each other using their pricing, product, and inventory strategy under the instructor specified models. Our simulation takes several parameters for the simulation model and provides an established simulation environment, graphical assessment charts and Excel data for tracking the performance of different students. According to our user acceptance test, our program is successful at aforementioned features, providing a suitable educational simulation environment and meeting the needs of industrial engineering faculty.
